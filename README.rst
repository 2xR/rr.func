Functional programming toolset for Python :)

This module defines some higher-order functions that can be made useful in functional-style programming. For example, these functions allow us to quickly compose arbitrarily complex function pipelines, and already provide some commonly used operations *e.g.* sum or product (over functions instead of values).

All the tools in this module take one or more functions and produce new functions.

Compatibility
=============

Developed and tested in Python 3.6+. The code may or may not work under earlier versions of Python 3 (perhaps back to 3.3).


Installation
============

From the github repo:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/2xR/rr.func.git
